# Treasure Trove
A collection of standalone useful (or not!) scripts. All resources are written
in Python and there are currently no plans to expand them to other languages.
By default, these do not require special 3rd party libraries unless specified
otherwise.

## Contents
1. consecutivesum - Returns the number of possible subset of integers that sum
up to _exactly_ n, for a given range of positive integers from 1 to n.

2. lookandsay - Prints the n-th term of the look-and-say sequence.
